There are a lot of things going on in the next few weeks &#8212; so with a maximum of one further ado, here are the things going on in the next few weeks.

ado.

*Gladiators play test* (Jan. 5)  
If you&#8217;re in the downtown area tonight and want to see what&#8217;s going on in the indie board gaming scene in Montreal, [Foonzo][1] will be hosting a playtest of *[Gladiators][2]*, a new title from local video-game-industry-to-independent-board-game developers Geoff Rollins and Patrice Combatalade.

*CUSEC and DemoCamp* (Jan. 19-21)  
The [Canadian University Software Engineering Conference][3] is a great opportunity to hear from and speak with software engineers from a wide range of backgrounds and industries. This year, Manveer Heir of BioWare Montr&eacute;al will be speaking (among a long list of excellent presentations), and the conference is being sponsored in part by [Riot Games][4] (who are currently in the midst of a recruitment drive) &#8212; so, basically: video games! They are of interest. Relatedly, the CUSEC [DemoCamp][5] offers developers the chance to live-demo a work-in-progress; [Norwegian Wood][6] and other games have been shown rather successfully in the past. The application deadline for projects is Jan. 10, and thus many of you have several days of interesting programming ahead. Enjoy!

*Global Game Jam* (Jan. 27-29)  
The [Global Game Jam][7]&#8216;s 48 hours of international game development madness is approaching, and Concordia and l’ÉTS are co-ordinating on a jam site for Montreal participants. The plan is to accommodate up to 150 programmers/designers/artists/woodworkers/&#038;c. for the duration; pre-made teams, randomly-generated teams, individuals, and floaters are all welcome, as are both digital and physical/board games. A URL with registration will be up shortly [EDIT: [here][8] it is!] &#8212; in the meantime, [here][9] is a list of different names for animal collectives, not counting the band Animal Collective.

*Toy Company Festival* (Feb. 10-12)  
Local chiptune collective (&#8220;a linked-list of electronic musicians&#8221;?) [Toy Company][10] will be hosting a grand ole two-night shindig of 8-bit music, 16-bit dancing, and 93-bit revelry &#8212; more revelries than there are atoms in the observable universe. Local artists will be playing alongside *special international guests*, so not only is it contractually obligated to be a mad party, but it&#8217;s also a great opportunity to showcase the local game scene! Let&#8217;s make this explicit:  
*WE ARE LOOKING FOR GAMES*.  
If you&#8217;d like to make and/or showcase a game for the show, we want you to do that thing as well. The call is open for retro-aesthetic/lo-fi, easily-accessible games &#8212; preferably ones that are not dependent on audio, since the music, scientifically speaking, will be bumpin&#8217;. Contact us and make it happen.

salutation and end transmission.

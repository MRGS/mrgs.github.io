Our penultimate pronouncement of princely playables!

Project SkyFortress is an upcoming game by duo [Owen Deery][1] & [Gabriel Verdon][2], themselves talented up-and-coming mover-and-shakers hailing from Ottawa. A sidescrolling blue-skies build-&#8217;em-up, the Prince of Arcade preview of SkyFortress will most certainly feature brutally balletic broadsides, fearsome fusillades, and scathing salvos of sizzling split-screen ship-on-ship action.

A lovely trailer down below. The appointed hour draws near! Can you taste it?

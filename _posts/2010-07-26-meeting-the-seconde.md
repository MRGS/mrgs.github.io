Our second meetup was the hottest one yet, pretty much literally because we were in the middle of the Summer&#8217;s worst heatwave in a room with no air-conditioning. But regardless! A great host of brave, horrendously dehydrated souls arrived at [L&#8217;Amère à Boire][1] to both quench their thirst and continue this analogy equating &#8220;eating and drinking&#8221; with &#8220;talking about game development.&#8221;

[Darius Kazemi][2]&#8212;of the [IGDA][3]&#8216;s Board of Directors and co-organiser of the [Boston GameLoop][4] unconference&#8212;broke the ice by discussing the latter, and extending an invitation to one and all: it&#8217;s Saturday, August 28th, so mark your calendars. Darius then moved on to describe the emerging HTML5 web standard, as well as the fledgling [Akihabara][5] API for HTML5 game development (be sure to check out Darius&#8217; and Darren Torpey&#8217;s Akihabara [tutorials][6]). After a few questions from the audience, the night moved on to our usual open-mike/open-laptop demo format, where devs could show off their works-in-progress, and chat and make merry with their peers.

As usual, a huge thank-you to all who attended, in particular Heather Kelley (our originally-scheduled speaker), who managed to make it up an inordinate number of stairs despite an impressive-looking leg brace; and of course to Darius for having driven all the way up from Boston to be with us for the evening.

We&#8217;ll see you all again soon.

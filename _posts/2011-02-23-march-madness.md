Villains! Vandals! Visigoths! The stars have (mis)aligned, and our cherished Prima Wednesdunum (made-up Latin for &#8220;First Wednesday of the month&#8221;) has been usurped by vicious, heartless, well, usurpers. That&#8217;s okay though, because we&#8217;re inviting all the *cool* people (and anyone else who&#8217;s available, really) to a meetup the following Wednesday. 

Note the change in date! It&#8217;s a March Madness that should at very least confuse spambots and robotic internet spiders and frankly, that was my favourite sentence to write.

*WHEN*  
Wednesday, **March 9th**, 19h30

*WHERE*  
Brasserie Artisanale lâ€™Am&egrave;re &agrave; Boire, 2049 rue Saint-Denis, 3rd floor

*WHO*  
You lot.

*WHAT*  
Well, March Madness seems to be all about gambling (we think), so we&#8217;re going to put our money on video games being discussed, beers being consumed, and baked goods being savoured.

Jackpot and/or checkmate!

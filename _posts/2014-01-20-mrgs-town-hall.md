It&#8217;s a new year &#8211; time for MRGS to try some new things. Join us at our first Town Hall meeting to discuss governance, propose activities or events, and talk about how we can best support each other and make more wonderful games-related things happen in the city of Montreal.

Everyone is welcome, regardless of whether you have a specific idea or point of discussion in mind. We&#8217;d like to make sure everyone&#8217;s voice gets heard.

This first meeting will be informal, fairly brief, and probably a little ad-hoc. Here are a few things we&#8217;d like to touch upon:

- Discussion of MRGS&#8217;s mandate  
- Setting up an open mailing list for organizational talk  
- Establishing a board; implications, responsibilities, membership  
- Some things we&#8217;d like to make happen this year

If you can&#8217;t make it but still want to be involved or kept in the loop: shoot us [an email][1] and we&#8217;ll make sure you get a copy of the minutes/notes afterwards. (We&#8217;ll be posting them on the blog as well.) This is the currently the best channel to get in touch with thoughts/comments in general, too.

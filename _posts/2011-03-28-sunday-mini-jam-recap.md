Many moons ago (four), we [postulated](http://www.montrealindies.com/?p=163) most heretically the possibility of getting together on a crisp Spring weekend to make merry, drink coffee, and work feverishly for three hours on arbitrary game prototypes&#8212;or at least, to familiarise ourselves with [Unity](http://unity3d.com).

An [oracle](http://norefuge.net/vgng/vgng.html) was consulted; titles were chosen. Three hours later, it was all over. The dust settled. The smoke cleared. The noun verbed. The games revealed themselves to us, in no particular order (read: alphabetical order).

Fun times were had by all, and I think it&#8217;s safe to say that each of us learned a valuable lesson about peer pressure. Keep an eye out for future get togethers!

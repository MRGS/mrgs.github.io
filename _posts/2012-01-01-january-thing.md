Whoa now! A few too many Festivus grievances were aired and a couple extra auld langs may have been syned &#8212; we&#8217;ve been remiss in announcing our upcoming meetup! But hey, we know you fine folk keep all your first monthly Wednesdays free, so let&#8217;s get right to it: a meetup this week!

Let&#8217;s start off the new Gregorian year with a bang, or in style, or with some other indicator &#8212; indicators for all! Did you participate in [Ludum Dare][1]? Looking for partners in the upcoming [Global Game Jam][2]? Want to make a game for the upcoming [Toy Company][3] festival?

Convene // discuss // indicate! We consider it unlikely that you will regret it!

*WHEN*  
Wednesday, January 4th, 19h30

*WHERE*  
Brasserie Artisanale lâ€™Am&egrave;re &agrave; Boire, 2049 rue Saint-Denis, 3rd floor

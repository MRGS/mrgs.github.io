*You awaken from a deep slumber. There is an INTERNET to the NORTH. AUGUST is around the air and CHANGE is in the corner.  
**> get change_**  
&#8220;Change&#8221; is non-corporeal and cannot be picked up.*

Yes, August is indeed around the bend, and big (read: moderate) changes are afoot. With our normal venue undergoing *massive* (read: moderate) renovations, we&#8217;re taking our show on the road. A challenger approacheth in the form of Foonzo Caf&eacute;, which will be taking over hosting duties for this month&#8217;s meetup. With a stack of homemade arcade cabs, beers on tap, bubble teas, and some amount of air conditioning, we&#8217;re hoping for a huge (read: moderate) success!

*WHEN*  
Wednesday, August 3rd, 19h30

*WHERE*  
**Foonzo Caf&eacute;, 1245 rue Drummond** (This this this! Look closely at this!)

*WHAT*  
A hike down the road from our usual venue, Dr. Zhivago-style. Then: video games! Dr. Zhivago-style.

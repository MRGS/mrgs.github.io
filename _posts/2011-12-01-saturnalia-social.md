Io, Saturnalia! The festival of Cronus is almost upon us, and you know what that means! With the unbinding of the statues of Saturn in temples across the land, it&#8217;s time to rejoice! Join our *Saturnalicius princeps* as we exchange small gifts (*sigillaricia*) and allow slaves to gamble and dine with their masters!*

(*Courtesy Wikipedia &#8212; A personal appeal from *Iacomus Wales*.)

It&#8217;s meetup time, folks. Let us rock out as in days of old, before retiring for the holy-days. Togas optional but strongly encouraged.

*WHERE*  
Brasserie Artisanale lâ€™Am&egrave;re &agrave; Boire, 2049 rue Saint-Denis, 3rd floor

[The Prince of Arcade][1] will be making its majestic appearance less than two weeks hence! Let&#8217;s start talking about some of the games we&#8217;ll have available for play.

First up: we&#8217;re excited to announce that Pico³, by Les Collégiennes ([Aliceffekt][2] + [Renaud Bédard][3]) will be present! Check out the new gameplay trailer:



A project only one month in the making, it&#8217;s already looking sweet and (we can confirm) playing beautifully. We can&#8217;t wait to show it!

We&#8217;ll be rolling out more games in the days to come, so [stay tuned][4].

Long Live the Prince!

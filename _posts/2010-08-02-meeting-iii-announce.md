Hey everyone! July has sped past altogether too quickly&#8212;what with vacation time, warm weather, and general Summer-in-Montreal-ness&#8212;and that means the August meetup is just around the corner.

Astonishingly so.

And so, without further ado (and at something of the last minute), we&#8217;re going to be getting together this Wednesday. In other words:

*WHAT:* Montreal game developer meetup  
*WHEN:* This Wednesday, August 4th, at 7pm (19:00)  
*WHERE:* [L’Amère à Boire][1] brewpub, upstairs.

(Also see the [Facebook event][2], if you&#8217;re into that sort of thing.)

Come along for the usual discussions and demos, bring your laptops and secret projects, and let us <s>dance</s> sit the night away, in the company of friends.

For your health!

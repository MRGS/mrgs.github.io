Well blow us down and refer to us collectively as a monkey&#8217;s uncle&#8212;this month&#8217;s meetup was an administrative success for all ages 18 and over!

After a quick rundown of coming events (read: go register for [TOJam](http://tojam.ca) on Monday, April 11th), we came to the gooey caramel centre of things: the caramel and/or games. [Francis Coulombe](http://www.frankiesmileshow.com/) gave a sneak peek at his work on *Prosthetic*, a frenetic Genesis-era shooter for heavy metal metalheads Last Chance To Reason. And it was good. And then we played [GIRP][1] together, and [Sumotori](http://www.gravitysensation.com/sumotori/), and [Winner vs. Loser](http://www.foddy.net/WinnervsLoser.html), and those were good too. It was a pretty good night. Let&#8217;s keep this energy going for added multipliers!

All interested parties are encouraged in a totally non-judgmental and peer pressure-free way to come out for our weekly [mini jams](http://www.montrealindies.com/?p=165). The non-denominational fun goes down at [Foonzo](http://foonzo.com/a-propos/nos-heures/) tomorrow (April 10th) any time after lunch&#8212;and as luck and cosmic circumstance would have it, that coincides with the first monthly [Blitzkast](http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=18910.0) jam! You literally have no excuse admissible in a court of law!

Onwards!

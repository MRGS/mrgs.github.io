This week, after a brief panic that the Mount Royal Game Society was about to get together somewhere in the realm of a reasonable temperature, the mercury climbed back up to &#8220;Uncomfortable,&#8221; and our fourth meetup was underway.

Despite the heat, we had another great turnout at the bar, with plenty of new faces in attendance as well as a visit from a few of our counterparts in Ottawa, the [Dirty Rectangles][1]. Thanks again to everyone who dropped by, presented a game, or simply contributed their body heat to the noble cause of melting lead at ambient room temperature.

Update: Check out Guert&#8217;s write-up [here][2]!

Meine Freunde! Ich bin ins Deutsche &uuml;bersetzt!

Fall has sprung (what?) and that means that the beer volcanoes are almost ready for harvest (what?) and the German people and anyone with a taste for beer is unpacking the lederhosen (what?). *Oktoberfest* is here! In which we celebrate the miracle of the harvest season and our communion with each other and with the land by solemnly overindulging in Pabst Blue Ribbon and passing out on the nearest frat couch.

To mark the occasion in our own little way, who&#8217;s up for a meetup? Yes, yes we thought you might.

*WHEN*  
Wednesday, **October 12th**, 19h30

*WHERE*  
Brasserie Artisanale lâ€™Am&egrave;re &agrave; Boire, 2049 rue Saint-Denis, 3rd floor

*WHAT*  
Note the change of date! Once again, we&#8217;re pushing the meetup back a week to accommodate this month&#8217;s awesome speaker&#8212;Doug Wilson, of the [Copenhagen Game Collective][1]! The CGC has been doing some really amazing stuff, with games like *B.U.T.T.O.N.*, *Johann Sebastian Joust*, and *F*ck You, It&#8217;s Art* turning heads among players and designers alike. Doug will be on hand and hilariously jet-lagged to talk about his own experiences and projects within the group. It&#8217;s an Oktoberfest miracle!

O&#8217;zapft is!

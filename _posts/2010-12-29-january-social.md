Yes, friends, it&#8217;s that wonderfully symbolic time of year that the Gregorians so thoughtfully provided us for recovering from food comas and tweeting our sincerest holiday Top Ten lists. The new year is just around the corner, and that means more introspection than you can shake a blog at. Where should the Mount Royal Game Society go from here? What would you like to see happen over the coming year? How can we acquire ever more and more varied [sweet breads][2]? Let us ponder these questions during the JANUARY MEETUP.

WHEN: Wednesday, January 5th, *19h30* (Note the slightly more different time.)

WHERE: Brasserie Artisanale l’Amère à Boire, 2049 rue Saint-Denis, 3rd floor

WHO: Artists, designers, musicians, coders, and other ne&#8217;er-do-wells with inclinations towards playing and discussing and making games. Nary a ne&#8217;er-do-well need feel uninvited.

WHAT: This month, in addition to the now-standard open-mic drinks-n-demos, we&#8217;ll be holding an open forum on the future of the Mount Royal Game Society. We&#8217;re here for you, so let&#8217;s hear about things you want to have going on under the aegis of th&#8217;MRGS. 2011 will be an exciting year!

Also, bust out your best recipes. We will battle them like Pokémons.

See you there!

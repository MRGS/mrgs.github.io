It has recently been brought to our attention that there are some people making video games in Montreal. Who knew?! To celebrate this surprising discovery, we&#8217;re throwing our very own [Pecha Kucha][1]/microtalks night&#8212;an opportunity for those hard-working folks within the industry (and without) to rant and rave about everything they see as right, and wrong, and morally ambiguous about this crazy world we call game development. 

*THE MICROTALK FORMAT*  
Anywhere from ten to twenty speakers spend the evening giving rapid-fire presentations.  
**Each presentation is limited to 5 minutes, 20 slides, and 20 seconds per slide.**  
Within these arbitrary constraints lies the key to inspirational, complex beauty, like Conway&#8217;s Game of Life or, to a lesser extent, Minesweeper. When and where is this happening? you ask. We&#8217;re keeping that a secret!

*WHEN*  
Thursday, August 18th, 2011  
19h00 &#8212; 23h00

*WHERE*  
[Eastern Bloc][2]  
[7240 rue Clark][3]

***THE MOST IMPORTANT BIT***  
*We&#8217;re looking for speakers!*  
A night of microtalks is (rather literally) nothing without its speakers, so we&#8217;re putting out an open call. As with our own monthly meetups, we&#8217;re looking for presenters from all walks of the world of game development: artists, coders, writers, musicians, designers, indies, studios&#8212;in short, anyone who&#8217;s so much as sketched a game idea on a napkin is welcome. In fact, napkins were *almost mandatory* until more sober minds prevailed.

If you&#8217;d like to present at *TIME ATTACK*, [email us][4] with your hastily-scribbled proposal, including:

*   Name
*   Affiliation
*   Proposed topic
*   And, why not, a Twitter-length summary*

(* We also accept MySpace- and Geocities-length summaries)

*TIME ATTACK*! Be there! [Speak there][4]! Good times and anti-oxidants for all!

In all the kerfuffle (ker.fuf.fle: [noun][1], *pl. kerfuffles*; a commotion or fuss) surrounding our [evening of happiness][2], did you think we&#8217;d neglected our traditional November meetup? Faugh! (fau.gh: exclamation, *pl. faughbags*; pretty much a silly word anyway)

November! It&#8217;s a game demoing month! And do we have demos for you! Yes, yes we do. But first, take note of the date: to accommodate the Prince of Arcade (you should [go to it][3]), we&#8217;ve pushed the meetup back from the 2nd to the 9th!

*WHEN*  
Wednesday, **November 9th**, 19h30

*WHERE*  
Brasserie Artisanale lâ€™Am&egrave;re &agrave; Boire, 2049 rue Saint-Denis, 3rd floor

*WHAT*  
Two glorious game demos from our very own [Fran&ccedil;is][4] and [Michel][5]. Frankie will be presenting *Non Human*, a new action-sidescroller, whilst Michel will give us a first glimpse of *Playfair*, his reboot of the base management/strategy genre.

You should check them out. They make amazing things.

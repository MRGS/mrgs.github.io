What with 2012 being a leap year (*despite*, or *because of*?), it&#8217;s been a wild February for the Game Society. Opening with a helping hand in two fantastic events &#8212; [Mixcade][1] and [Toy Company Festival][2] (more about those soon!) &#8212; it&#8217;s only fitting to wrap it all up in a soft taco shell.

Amazing things this weekend:

#### >>> NUIT BLANCHE // YU WA [GAMES/PEACE] <<<

*Saturday Feb. 25, 17h00-03h00*

La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des arts technologiques (the SAT, you acronymophiles) is throwing a party for [Nuit blanche][3] Saturday night. Should your nightly perambulations carry you thither, stop on in for a refreshing beverage, dance-party melodies, and a place to sit down with some wall-projected video games. Video games! You like those, right?

#### >>> Pirate Kart Jam <<<

*All weekend; Group jam Sunday Feb. 26, All day*

Another year, another controversy-free Independent Games Festival. The recent [IGF Pirate Kart][6] was an incredible creative success with over 300 games submitted, and *it&#8217;s happening again* &#8212; just in time for this year&#8217;s [Game Developers Conference][7]!

This weekend, game jammers across North Dakota &#8212; and beyond! &#8212; are invited to participate in the [2012-in-One Glorious Developers Konference Kollection][8]: to slam together with great gumption and ceremony as many crazy projects as the Internet can possibly hold, and unleash them on a possibly-suspecting San Francisco.

Meanwhile, we&#8217;ll be teaming up with sister groups in Ottawa and Toronto for a Tri-city-fecta of game jamming spamming. The jam lasts all weekend long, so hunkering down at home is one option &#8212; but jamming is best among friends. Let us know if and when and where you&#8217;re laying down your laptops, and we&#8217;ll see if we can&#8217;t all team up together for some in-person high-fiving game design action. Will there be live video streaming of the event, you ask? *Any*thing can happen!

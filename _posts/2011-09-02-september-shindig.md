September Scheduling Error? September Somewhat Delayed? Slow Down, September? Whatever the nomenclature, take note MRGSers! (Mergseyists? You people.) This month&#8217;s meetup has been *pushed back* to the second week of September. What happened? Did we [attack time][1] so much it hurt? Yes. Yes we did.

The delay puts us on track to reclaim our state-mandated/Facebook-favourite spot at l’Am&egrave;re, as well as prepare our *new, exciting format for everything*. In addition to our ever-popular presentations, we&#8217;ll be encouraging more involved Amazing Demo Nights, with more discussion, more feedback, and more <s>fun</s> compelling life experiences&#8212;all starting this month!

*WHEN*  
Wednesday, **September 14th**, 19h30

*WHERE*  
Brasserie Artisanale l’Am&egrave;re &agrave; Boire, 2049 rue Saint-Denis, 3rd floor

*WHAT*  
Amazing Demos with mandatory Amazing Feedback! Demoers to be announced SOON!

On the heels of an awesome [February][1] comes an equally awe-full opening to March. Awe. It&#8217;s full of awe. Aww, yeah.

The [Game Developers Conference][2] is set to rock San Francisco next week, and to accommodate the sizable Montreal contingent that will be networking/recovering/contracting Swine Flu, *we&#8217;ve pushed our regular meetup back to **March 14th***. Auspices were consulted, and the outlook is positive.

The Ides of March: synonymous with family fun and senate reform!

*WHEN*  
Wednesday, **March 14th**, 19h30

*WHERE*  
Foonzo, 1245 rue Drummond, ([internet map][3]).

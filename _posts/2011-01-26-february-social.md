February. The runt of the monthly litter. The little month that could. The month at the kiddie table. The diminutives are many, but the result is quite singular: there&#8217;s Big Trouble in Little February. Cats and kittens, there&#8217;s a meetup afoot.

*WHEN*  
Wednesday, February 2nd, 19h30

*WHERE*  
Brasserie Artisanale lâ€™Am&egrave;re &agrave; Boire, 2049 rue Saint-Denis, 3rd floor

*WHO*  
You. Two of your friends. Then they invite two of *their* friends. Our lawyers assure us that it&#8217;s not a pyramid scheme if we&#8217;re not making any money.

*WHAT*  
An evening in several parts!

First, Aaron Saloman ([link](http://www.aaronmusic.com/) and [link](http://www.reverbnation.com/tvmusic)) shall regale us with tales of woe (whoa!) and triumph from his work composing music for television and video games. In particular, if you enjoyed the music in the award-winning *[Critter Crunch](http://crittercrunch.com/)* (PSN), from Toronto&#8217;s Capy Games, you have this man to thank and shower with praise. We don&#8217;t often hear from the musical side of game development, so this certainly has our bonnets all aflutter.

Parte the Seconde: You haven&#8217;t forgotten about the [Global Game Jam](http://globalgamejam.org/) this weekend, right? You (and possibly your friends) are going to employ alchemy and geomancy to bring fabulous games into being, right? Well, we want to play them. Granted, only two days separate the Jam and our meetup, but since when do we care about polish and completeness? Drop us a line in the comments down below if you&#8217;re feeling confident enough to showcase your game in our open-mic session&#8212;priority given to Global Game Jam participants!

And as per usual, the threat of baked goods looms ever-glowering in our hearts and minds.

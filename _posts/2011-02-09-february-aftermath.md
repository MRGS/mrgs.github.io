This month&#8217;s meetup was about as chock-full of sweet moments as one can get when filling things with chock.

Aaron Saloman ([hither](http://www.aaronmusic.com/) and [thither](http://www.reverbnation.com/tvmusic)) started things off by showcasing some of the back-and-forth email and musical exchanges with Toronto&#8217;s [Capy Games](http://www.capybaragames.com/) during the production of the awesome *Critter Crunch* (PSN). Despite the somewhat louder-than-usual venue, the clips were awesome and shed some light on the musical side of game development (a new perspective for our meetups).

Next up, we got a look a a few of the prior weekend&#8217;s local [Global Game Jam](http://globalgamejam.org/) entries. Richard Flanagan (of *[FRACT](http://richardeflanagan.com/#17-fract-adventure-game-design)*, featured [previously](http://www.montrealindies.com/?p=135)) fired it up with a super-keen chestcam video, paraphrased below:



The end result of all that high-speed wizardry is Team.MRCRF&#8217;s *[FADE](http://globalgamejam.org/2011/fade)*, a (typically) stylistic mash-up of pipe dream and Memory.

Team Silly Goose followed it up with *[Fataliste](http://globalgamejam.org/2011/fataliste)*, their short and nihilistic story of a little girl, a baseball bat, and a very, very angry comet.

Next, Team Henk Boom/Graham Lackey/Stephen Ascher threw on *[SQRL](http://globalgamejam.org/2011/sqrl)*, a frantic, squirrel-squad-based King-of-the-Hill variant.

And finally, Kenny Backus demoed his entry for TIGSource&#8217;s [Versus](http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?board=46.0) competition: *[Push vs. Shove](http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=17149.0)*, a competitive mash-up of a shmup, *Mario Bros.*, *Street Fighter*, and&#8212;why not&#8212;*Heavy Rain*.

A huge thanks once again to Aaron and all the presenters&#8212;and as always, drop us a line down below if you&#8217;ve got a project to showcase, a question for the developers, a suggestion for future meetups, or some sort of excellent muffin or shortbread recipe.

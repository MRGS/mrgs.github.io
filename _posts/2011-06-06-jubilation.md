Last Wednesday night was our annual First Annual First-Anniversary TOJam-Recapping [June Jubilee][1] Extravaganza-Fest, and it&#8217;s safe to say the majority of attendees were not disappointed! Huzzah for utilitarian success!

Last month, an expeditionary force of game-developing teams and individuals converged on Toronto for the [Toronto Game Jam][2], each one riffing in their own way on the Jam&#8217;s &#8220;What Just Happened&#8221; theme. The Jam itself was fantastic fun; the resulting games were as varied as they were plural, and the teams kindly ran their demos for an <s>adulterous</s> adulating crowd. Without further ado about nothing: we&#8217;ve collected the games below (in alphabetical order), for your browsing embrowsement. We&#8217;ll be providing links to the games as they come online, so check back often! Or follow us on [The Twitters][3] or [The Facebooks][4] for the latest.

(Click through the images! More embiggened images available where available!)

*Fuzzer* by Henk Boom  
*Tron* meets *Rock &#8216;n Roll Racing* and they have a baby in a rugby scrum. Competitive two-player racing that shines in its beautiful drifting physics.

*[Newton64&#8242;s Revised King James Bible][6]* by Nick Rudzicz  
The Adam &#038; Eve story you were never meant to hear! NSFW physics! M. Bison! Anyway, the developer doesn&#8217;t like talking about himself in the third person, so the post-mortem writeup will suffice!

*[RAIN+BOW][8]* by Les coll&eacute;giennes  
Take all the shmups you&#8217;ve ever played and all the drugs you&#8217;ve ever taken and there&#8217;s your weekend. [Aliceffekt][9] provides a soundtrack that will literally melt your face.

*Station 37* by Renaud Cormier and Fran&ccedil;is Coulombe  
This official recruitment game of the FDNY really &#8220;turns up the heat&#8221; (this is a pun because of fire). From the SuperNES school of design, it features gorgeous aesthetic sensibilities and a narrative arc that&#8217;ll teach you the true meaning of fighting fires. Backdraft.

Thanks go out to all the presenters, and everyone who came out for the show. See you in July!

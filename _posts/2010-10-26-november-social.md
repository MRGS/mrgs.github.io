A disclaimer: we here at the Mount Royal Game Society never set out to explicitly embarrass or shame anyone, and certainly no member should ever feel beholden to the Society as a whole. However, we feel it necessary to remind everyone that *baked goods* were available at our last meeting.

*Dangerous precendents have been set here*, people.

Of course, it is entirely co-incidental that we bring this up just in time to announce our *Gala Six-Month Anniversary Bash*!!!

*WHAT:* A game developer meetup, of course!

*WHO:* As always: musicians, artists, designers, coders, chinchillas, tuco-tucos, and other mammals who love to play and discuss and make videogames are welcome.

*WHEN:* Wednesday, November 3 @ **19:30** (note the small change in timing!)

*WHERE:* [L&#8217;amère à boire][1] brewpub (2049 Rue Saint-Denis, Montreal)

*WHAT, AGAIN:* This month will be an open-mic night, so bring your game demos and constructive criticisms. Baked goods are optional&#8212;you know, as is our happiness. No pressure.

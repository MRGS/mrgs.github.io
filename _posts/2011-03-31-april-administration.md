Because nothing&#8212;absolutely nothing&#8212;brings all the adults of consenting age to the yard like the promise of some unrelenting administration.

So what&#8217;s up? *SO MUCH*, cats and kittens! [L&#8217;Arcade Royale](https://groups.google.com/group/montrealindies/browse_thread/thread/f494fa00121b30cf) is still a thing that needs to happen. [Weekly gatherings](https://groups.google.com/group/montrealindies/browse_thread/thread/b7647f8dfc839188) are happening, even culminating in a [mini game jam](http://www.montrealindies.com/?p=165) last weekend. And hey&#8212;speaking of game jams, the [Toronto Game Jam](http://www.tojam.ca/home/default.asp) is coming up in a month and a half!

So come on down, grab a pint, form game jam squads, brainstorm arcade designs, and relax amongst friends and Facebook acquaintances. When and where is this happening, you ask? We at the MRGS are a cunning, puzzle-loving folk, and so we&#8217;ve hidden the details *right here in this very blog post!*

*WHEN*  
Wednesday, April 6th, 19h30

*WHERE*  
Brasserie Artisanale lâ€™Am&egrave;re &agrave; Boire, 2049 rue Saint-Denis, 3rd floor

*WHO*  
The majority of the literate populace.

*WHAT*  
Mass brainstorming, not unlike that one episode of *Futurama*.

As always, let us know ahead of time if you&#8217;ve got demos to share, and we&#8217;ll play them into the wee hours of at least 9:30pm.

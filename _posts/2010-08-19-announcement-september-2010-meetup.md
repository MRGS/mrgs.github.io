Slowly but surely, September is creeping up on us, ready to sucker-punch the summer wind right out of out lungs. We say: to heck with that! Let&#8217;s ring the month in with awesome friends, good beer, and excellent indie games! Cranky ol&#8217; September will have no choice but to crack a smile and join in the merriment. Yes: it is time for a MEETUP.

*WHEN*: Wednesday, September 1, 7:00 pm

*WHERE*: Brasserie Artisanale l’Amère à Boire, 2049 rue Saint-Denis, 3rd floor

*WHO*: Anyone interested in creating games! As always, musicians, artists, designers, coders, and aspiring game-makers of all feathers are welcome!

This month, we&#8217;ll be doing a demo of some accessible but powerful game creation utilities. There are plenty of great tools for making games that don&#8217;t require any prior programming knowledge &#8212; perfect if you&#8217;re burning to make a game on your own but don&#8217;t know how to start, or are just curious to get your feet wet. Approaches, alternatives and *secret cheat codes* will also be discussed. Let&#8217;s get game-makin&#8217;!

Summer has officially arrived, and to heck with the Southern hemisphere! While our friends in Namibia and Papua New Guinea trundle through their cold, dark snowdrifts, we up here in the North know how to take advantage of any temperature above freezing. The days are long, and that means one thing: socialising! Social games! Social networks! Social dancing! Social sciences! Game developers all over are getting *social*; &#8220;*so shall*&#8221; we. (Yes!)

Let&#8217;s embrace this Summer Socialism! *[nb. look up this word before posting]*

*WHEN*  
Wednesday, July 6th, 19h30

*WHERE*  
Brasserie Artisanale lâ€™Am&egrave;re &agrave; Boire, 2049 rue Saint-Denis, 3rd floor

*WHAT*  
Beers, video games, good times with your Comrades!

Bring a game demo, grab a beer: from each according to their means, to each according to their needs.

Game devs of the world: try Unity! You have nothing to lose but your toolchains!

I can literally do this all day.

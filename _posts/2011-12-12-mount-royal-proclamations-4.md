As we mentioned at last week&#8217;s meetup, there&#8217;s quite a lot in store to sate the palate of the sophisticated games connoisseur in Montreal. In no particular order by date:

[Ludum Dare 22][1] (December 16-19)  
The arbitrarily-regular weekend-long Internetional game jam is returning in just a few days to an Internet near you! Devote a weekend to variations on an LD-sanctioned theme.

[Global Game Jam][2] (January 27-29)  
A similar game jam! One weekend! One theme! One love! We jammin&#8217;! Organisers at Concordia and l&#8217;&Eacute;TS are putting together spaces for teams and individuals to get together over the weekend; we&#8217;ll be posting more about this as registration opens.

[IGDA DemoNight][3] (January 31)  
The [IGDA][4] is throwing a demo night in January, and have put out an open call for submissions. If you&#8217;ve got a game idea rattling around, set yourself a deadline to show it to your peers (at least, the ones who don&#8217;t make it out to the meetups)! The deadline&#8217;s January 13th &#8212; grab those punch cards and get cracking.

Concordia Media Mix (February 4-5)  
Concordia will be hosting a multi-disciplinary conference in February, focusing in particular on popular Japanese culture and contrasting it with the scene on this side of the pond. The games scene will also be showcased, with both Japanese and local titles playable on-site. Again, more info as it becomes available!

[Toy Company Festival][5] (February 11-12)  
The local chiptune collective is putting on a two-day festival at the [SAT][6], and they&#8217;re looking to showcase local game dev talent along with it. We&#8217;re looking for 4-6 games to fill the bill, with a few qualitative constraints: a non-reliance on music and sound (the tunes will be blaring pretty heavily), a retro aesthetic (SuperNES or backwards-Famicompatible), and an ability to be picked up and played while drunk (logistics). Easy peasy.  
[CONTACT US][7] if you&#8217;d like to submit a game and take part in the celebration. And check out Toy Company&#8217;s upcoming [8-Bit No&euml;l][8] concert for a glimpse into how the night will go down.

&#8212;-

Are you SO EXCITED yet? That&#8217;s good. There&#8217;s a tonne of interesting venues opening up, so start sharing ideas! Also we should probably do things like coding programs and making art and that stuff.

Video games! Let&#8217;s make &#8216;em.

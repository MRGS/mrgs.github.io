This past Wednesday, we once again celebrated the start of a new month with the best meetup ever.

As promised, [Jonathan Lavigne][1] and his crew got things started, walking us through the creation of [Scott Pilgrim vs. the World: The Game][2] from pitch to PSN. They spoke about the managerial hurdles they encountered along the way, including the slight technical problem of essentially moving the entirety of the game&#8217;s production to studios in China. But despite what could otherwise have been disastrous circumstances, the team was able to stay passionate about the project and bring to market a game that&#8217;s been getting some seriously good reviews. It was inspiring to see what a small, dedicated group of individuals was able to pull off with a modest pitch and a lot of elbow/keyboard grease.

Jonathan and his crew were followed up by Fred Smyczynski ([Dijiko][3]), who eased us into the open-mike portion of the night with his upcoming Flash game Meteor Wars. As seems to be becoming typical with our open-mike format, both Meteor Wars and the subsequently-demoed games were looking sweet, and were well-received by the crowd. If terrible weather is the price we pay for consistently awesome indie games, then we say bring it on!*

And so, we all danced and sang and played and chatted into the evening. And there was pie. And it was good.

* For the most part. Sun and reasonable temperatures would be kind of nice too. Maybe?

![2011 June Jubilee]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.oldwpdir }}/uploads/2011/05/MRGS_11_06_Social.png)

A lot can happen in a year, and nowhere is this more evident than on the planet Earth, where the concept was originally developed. Scientists working around the clock and around the Sun have determined to within twelve parsecs of accuracy that the Mount Royal Game Society will be exactly *one year old* this June!

What does all this mean? Well, set your phasers to &#8220;Undue Nostalgia,&#8221; because we&#8217;ll be having a One-Year Anniversary Special, featuring hilarious cameos and poignant slow-motion montages from our illustrious history (whoever can forget the tragic and predominantly hilarious end of Lt. Tasha Yar?)

Or maybe, just maybe, we&#8217;ll forgo all that and relax in our customary devil-may-care way.

*WHEN*  
Wednesday, June 1st, 19h30

*WHERE*  
Brasserie Artisanale lâ€™Am&egrave;re &agrave; Boire, 2049 rue Saint-Denis, 3rd floor

*WHAT*  
The yearly [Toronto Game Jam][1] was held earlier this month, and it was about as magical as one can get while maintaining a firm belief in the rational order of the Cosmos. We were lucky enough to have a good number of teams representing MRGS and Montreal as a whole, so this month will be all about the Jam. Come on out and see what wonders your peers can create when they&#8217;re deprived of sleep and fed on a strict diet of caffeine, carbohydrates, and industrial quantities of corn syrup.

And to all you jammers: get your games in! [Contact][2] the MRGS or leave a comment down below, and let us know that your team&#8217;s willing to share its game jam game (jam?). We&#8217;ll use the Power Of Technology to ensure all our jamees (game jam game) get a chance to demo.

There will be baked goods. There will be beer. And we&#8217;re not saying that there *will* prizes to be won, but let&#8217;s just say that a little birdie told us that there *will* be prizes to be won.

If there&#8217;s one thing [The Prince of Arcade][1] enjoys in his leisure time, it&#8217;s wicked-sweet music and falling/flying through abstract 3D spaces at high speeds.

Finally, a developer understands.

[Dejobaan Games][2], who brought us the award-winning [*AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! &#8212; A Reckless Disregard for Gravity*][3] last year, have a new game coming down the pipes (pun righteously intended), and we&#8217;re thrilled to announce that The Prince of Arcade will be bringing it to the public for the first time! Formerly under the working title of *ooo! ooO! oOO! OOO!*, it is with great solemnity and pride that we present:

*1&#8230; 2&#8230; 3&#8230; Kick It! &#8212; Drop That Beat Like an Ugly Baby*, by Dejobaan Games

Glorious. We absolutely can&#8217;t wait!

Check out the trailer for Kick It! below, and [stay tuned][4] for more announcements!

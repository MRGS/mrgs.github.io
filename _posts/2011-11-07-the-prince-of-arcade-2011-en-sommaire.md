This past Wednesday, for the second year running, the Prince of Arcade came to town&#8212;giving [MIGS][1] attendees and game enthusiasts alike the chance to relax with their peer groups and play some amazing indie games. In no particular order, the following are things that made the evening rather spiffy:

#### The Games

*La raison d&#8217;&ecirc;tre*. What would a video game party be without sweet sweet games?  
*(Check out videos and trailers [here][2])*

*   *Hohokum* by [Honeyslug and Richard Hogg][3]
*   *Hokra* by [Ramiro Corbetta][4]
*   *Johann Sebastian Joust*: ***JOUST OF CANADA*** Edition by [die gute Fabrik][5]
*   *Pico Battle* by [Les collégiennes][6]
*   *PoleVaulter* by [Bennett Foddy][7]

&#8212;-

#### Arcade Royale

Crafted by hardware hackers [The Buttonmashers][8], our new indie arcade cab made its first public appearance featuring some amazing local games (and a special guest from out of town!).  
*(More info [here][9].)*

*   *Commander* by [Ephemere Games][10]
*   *Fuzzer* by [Henk Boom][11]
*   *Game Game Videogame* by [Joachim Despland][12]
*   *Pax Britannica* by [No Fun Games][13]
*   *Thrustburst Arcade* by [Umlautgames][14]
*   *Verteidiger* by [Kenny Backus][15]</em>

#### Sponsors

Huge amounts of gratitude are due to the sponsors for their huge amounts of assistance. That is, several large ISO standard units of assistance.

*   [Kokoromi Collective][16]
*   [TAG][17] Concordia

&#8212;-

#### Special Thanks

*   [The Dirty Rectangles][18] for all the help along the way, and for the unveiling of the amazing [Ottatron][19]!
*   The organisers at [MIGS][1], for supporting the cause and getting the word out.
*   [Battle Lava][20], for throwing down some incredible chiptunes.
*   Rich Lemarchand and Phil Fish for a seductively danceable DJ set.
*   And the kind folks at [Eastern Bloc][21], for patience and professionalism in helping set up the event.

&#8212;-  
And because the magical memories are so dear, the cameras were rolling and caught some magnificent moments of the event itself ([Let us know][22] if you&#8217;ve got your own!):

*   The Dirty Rectangles documented their journey [here][23].
*   Nick Rudzicz, co-organiser, has a [Picasa set][24] of the preparations.
*   Photographer Antonella Fratino captured some amazing shots [here][25].
*   Sagar Patel also caught a bunch and popped them up on [Picasa][26].
*   James Everett has a great set of shots from both MIGS and the Prince of Arcade [here][27].

&#8212;-  
Encore une fois, merci &agrave; tous. It was &eacute;poustouflant.

Let&#8217;s do this again sometime.

Long Live the Prince.

*PS: And finally, a note to all our local MRGS friends&#8212;don&#8217;t forget that there&#8217;s a [meetup][28] Wednesday night, the 9th! We will meet each other there, and drink deeply from tall draughts of keen memories.*

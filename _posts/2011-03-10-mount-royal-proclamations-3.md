First off, a joyous &#8220;Thank you&#8221; to all those men and women who came out for our March Madness meetup last night. Granted there were no specific speakers lined up, but frankly we consider any night that ends like this to be a rousing and theistically-inclusive success.

A bit short-notice, but if you&#8217;re passing by Concordia tomorrow and this weekend, check out the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=187312364637247" target="_blank">Great Canadian Appathon</a>, where teams are competing to put together mobile apps within a 48-hour window. There&#8217;s $45,000 in prize money to be won, so emotions will be high, bodies will be unwashed, and if you&#8217;re not already sold, our mail-order Mad Men style guide is underperformant. Come on now! Mobile games! Prizes! Less baked goods than our own meetups, but still&#8230;prizes!

And finally, we&#8217;re just going to say the following words in sequence and see what happens: Torontron. Winnitron. <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/montrealindies/browse_thread/thread/f494fa00121b30cf" target="_blank">L&#8217;Arcade Royale</a>, maybe? Join us in the Google Group for this pre-pre-pre-Alpha project-in-the-making.

Mergsey, over and out.

Amidst the hububblebobble of our [Amazing Arcade Announcement][1] (because we&#8217;re triple-AAAwesome), let us not forget our everymonth responsibilities!

The [September Shindig][2] is this Wednesday, September 14th, 19h30! At our usual haunt&#8212;lâ€™Am&egrave;re &agrave; Boire, 2049 rue Saint-Denis, 3rd floor! *But you knew that already!*

That which you did not know, presumably, is our lineup. Since we&#8217;re trying to tack more towards an alternation of demo nights and presentations, we&#8217;re starting things off in style with three sweet titles.

*   *Bratwurst Breakin&#8217;* &#8212; Stephen Ascher brings poppin&#8217; and lockin&#8217; to the cutthroat world of processed meatstuffs.
*   *Her Majesty&#8217;s Royal Space Armada* &#8212; Kenny Backus earns top marks for nomenclature and bonus marks for *holy hamburgers we want to play this*.
*   *Wizorb* &#8212; [Newly-formed][3] Tribute Games throw some block-breaking beats into a blender with certain NES RPG&#8217;s and cook up *something delicious*.

Videos below! Be there! Wednesday! The most interestingly-spelt day of the week!

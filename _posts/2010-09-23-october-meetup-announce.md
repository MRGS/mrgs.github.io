A call for help! Daylight hours are disappearing rapidly, and only you can save them! Actually, that&#8217;s false, as daily hours of sunlight are a function of the Earth&#8217;s axial tilt and the planet&#8217;s revolution about the Sun, and thus totally beyond our control. Allow us to propose instead a gathering of minds, games, and brews to distract us from the whims of astronomical happenstance: it&#8217;s time for another MEETUP!

*WHEN*: Wednesday, October 6, 7:00 pm

*WHERE*: Brasserie Artisanale l’Amère à Boire, 2049 rue Saint-Denis, 3rd floor

*WHO*: As always, musicians, artists, designers, coders, and everyone who loves to play and discuss and make videogames are welcome.

*SPECIAL GUEST(S)*: This month, we&#8217;re very excited to have [Jonathan Lavigne][1] with us to talk about his experience as designer of [Scott Pilgrim vs. the World: The Game][2]. Part postmortem, part dev rant, we can pretty much guarantee that it will be the most excellent thing you have ever experienced for free.*

&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;

The [Montreal International Game Summit][3] (MIGS) is coming up on November 8 and 9, and the Mount Royal Game Society is teaming up with sister groups from Canada and the US to get our party on and showcase some awesome games and projects from within our communities. Do you have something you&#8217;d like to see showcased at the event? If so, [get in touch][4] &#8212; we&#8217;d love to hear from you. More details forthcoming shortly, so watch this space!

Our August meetup was somewhat more modest than the previous two, due to a potent mix of Summer vacations, mysterious injuries, concerts and events, and extraordinarily variable weather. The fact that we [announced][1] the meetup only days beforehand probably had little, if anything, to do with it.

Irregardlessly of the turnout, Stephen busted out some demos from the [recently released][2] Pirate Kart (Part II), and enjoyable times were had by a mathematical majority of attendees. A roaring success!

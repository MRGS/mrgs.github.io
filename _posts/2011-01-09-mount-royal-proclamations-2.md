There&#8217;s something in the air these days, and we&#8217;re confident within reasonable tolerances that it&#8217;s not the less than 1.0% trace atmospheric elements to which we&#8217;ve grown accustomed. It&#8217;s a breath of fresh air, a brand new year bringing with it new resolutions and VSync issues, many of which can be addressed by downloading the most up-to-date drivers.

With these solemn thoughts in our hearts and minds and retinas, let us reflect a while on all the latest news that&#8217;s fit to column width.

The <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/" target="_blank">Global Game Jam</a> is, in the words of so many novelty T-shirts, kind of a big deal. Hundreds of teams and participants around the world engage in a 48-hour groundswell of game design, all in the spirit of having fun and <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">getting some mad XP</span> acquiring real-world start-to-finish design experience.

It&#8217;s taking place from January 28-30 this year, and activities are being planned at l&#8217;<a href="http://globalgamejam.org/sites/2011/conjure-ets-montreal" target="_blank">École de technologie supérieure</a> (ETS), where Conjure (the local game design club) is providing space for jammers to get together and work *en masse*. Entrance is free, though participants have to supply their own laptops and equipment, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">and the venue doesn&#8217;t provide full 48-hour access.</span>

**<span style="color: #ff0000;">EDIT</span>: Carl Leduc-Benoit of Conjure notes in the [comments][1] that ETS will in fact provide 48-hour access.**

Give us a shout down below if you&#8217;ll be attending, or if you&#8217;re planning on other GGJ events!

The Mount Royal Game Society has a logo!

![Oh, hello there.]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.oldwpdir }}/uploads/2011/01/Mergsey-300x300.png)

You may have noticed Mergsey (our unofficial name for him) (we also arbitrarily decided he was a male) around the Internet: on Facebook and on Twitter, for instance, as well as on our <a href="http://www.montrealindies.com/?tag=the-prince-of-arcade" target="_blank">Prince of Arcade</a> publicity. His sleek lines, bold simplicity, and party-girl attitude were all conceptualised and designed from the ground up by the very talented Mr. Phil Fish, of the <a href="http://polytroncorporation.com/" target="_blank">Polytron Corporation</a>. So a tip o&#8217; the crown and a hearty thank-you to Phil for his (as usual) clever and compelling work.

Expect to see more of Mergsey as we roll out more announcements and events in the future!

And last but certainly not least, don&#8217;t forget to sign up for, contribute to, and otherwise generally acknowledge the Mount Royal Game Society <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/montrealindies" target="_blank">Google Group</a>! It&#8217;s a great place to arrange co-working sessions, to offer your technical expertise, to look for beta testers or design collaborators&#8212;in short, to connect with other Game Society members and Start Making Amazing Things. Those letters were capitalised arbitrarily, but almost form &#8220;SMART&#8221; as an acronym. The auspices are overwhelmingly ambiguous!

Now let&#8217;s get out there and rock 2011 like it&#8217;s 1999 and Y2K is still a thing.

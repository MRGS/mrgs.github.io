You are awakened from a troubled sleep. In the darkness, a blinding light! A vision stands before you! Can it be?!

<center>
  <br /> &#8212; From a synaesthetic dimension beyond our understanding &#8212;</p> <p>
    &#8212; In an hour of desperate need &#8212;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &#8212; Weighing in at an intangible number of pounds &#8212;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &#8212; BEHOLD &#8212;
  </p>

    <em>THE PRINCE HAS RETURNED</em>

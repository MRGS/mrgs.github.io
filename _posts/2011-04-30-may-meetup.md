Frankly, we&#8217;re a little bit disappointed in ourselves. Here we&#8217;d been given this golden opportunity to name our upcoming meetup something extraordinarily clever, like &#8220;*MAYhem*&#8221; or &#8220;*[May the 4th Be With You](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Star_Wars_Day)*,&#8221; but instead what worked its way into the post title and banner image above was the entirely accurate and immensely banal &#8220;May Meetup.&#8221; Well heck, we may not be proud, here at the MRGS&#8212;but by Humphrey we&#8217;re descriptive. Please, examine the information below whilst we compose ourselves.

*WHEN*  
Wednesday, May 4th, 19h30

*WHERE*  
Brasserie Artisanale lâ€™Am&egrave;re &agrave; Boire, 2049 rue Saint-Denis, 3rd floor

*WHO*  
Repeat the words &#8220;semantic satiation&#8221; to yourself until they lose their meaning. At this point, everyone within earshot has been invited involuntarily.

*WHAT*  
Fresh off the release of *[Rebirth](http://www.worldofguert.com/rebirth/)*, Monsieur Daniel-David &#8220;Guert&#8221; Guertin will regale us with tales of woe and less-woe from his last few projects, both as part of a team developing iPhone games, and on his own most latest project. Most latest? Oh woe.

[The Prince of Arcade][1] approacheth, and the list of gameseth continues to groweth!

Looking for a break from the eye-bleedingly gorgeous visuals of today&#8217;s modern games? Nostalgic for the abstract-yet-compelling gameplay of the late 1970&#8242;s? Did you even *exist* in the late 1970&#8242;s? No matter: neither did the games in our retro homebrew lounge! We&#8217;ll be setting aside a room full of vintage consoles and not-so-vintage homebrew games, to relive the spirit of ingenuity and the focus on unique gameplay so much a part of the games of yesteryear.

To wit:

*   *A Slow Year*, by [Ian Bogost][2]. The Georgia Tech professor, videogame researcher, critic, designer (and so on) presents his [IndieCade-winning][3] collection of meditative game poems.
*   *Halo 2600*, by [Ed Fries][4]. A demake of Microsoft&#8217;s definitive Xbox franchise, from one of the prime movers of Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox project itself. Don&#8217;t miss Fries&#8217; keynote at [MIGS][5] on &#8220;beauty, constraints, and the Atari 2600.&#8221;
*   *JoustPong*, by [Kirk Israel][6]. &#8220;The future of gaming can be summed up in two words &#8212; Pong and Joust.&#8221; We couldn&#8217;t possibly put it any better. A glorious mash-up of two iconic games from the golden age of the arcade.
*   *Marble Craze*, by [Paul Slocum][7]. The multitalented artist/musician/hacker presents a technical accomplishment that also puts familiar hardware to novel and creative use.

Don&#8217;t forget to [stay tuned][8] for more Prince of Arcade news!

Long Live the Prince!

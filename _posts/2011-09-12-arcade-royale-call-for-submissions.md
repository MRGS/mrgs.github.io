Alright cats and kittens, the time has come.

Word on the street is that indie arcade cabs are [pretty][1] [much][2] [the][3] [coolest][4]. People (*real people*) have been clamouring for A Cab Of Our Own&#8212;and well, we say, clamour no longour! We hereby announce:

#### ARCADE ROYALE

Say it. Taste it. Roll it around in the glass. Accidentally drip a bit of it on the tablecloth, and cover it with salt so it doesn&#8217;t stain. Oh that&#8217;s fresh.

We have spoken with local hardware hackers [The Buttonmashers][5], who are *at this very second* devising beautiful things for a beautiful cab (peep the work-in-progress pictures, the last four or so [here][6]). Suffice it to say, this could look heavenly.

We have the hardware, now we need the games.

Your games.

We&#8217;re looking for: 4-6 titles from local Montreal developers&#8212;and perhaps a few special features from abroad&#8212;that are ready for *awesome-sweet arcade parties*. More submissions == a more delicious Royale. Needless to say, this is a FOUR-PLAYER CAB, and we&#8217;re most interested in games that take advantage of the affordances that offers! That said, we&#8217;re also totally interested in seeing creative uses of this control configuration. If you see those four joysticks as dual sets of twin sticks for two-player terror: GO FOR IT. If you think those four-button arrangements would work curiously well as directional controls: GO FOR IT. If you are convinced that the entire set of controls is just a rough stand-in for an unfathomable, alien control panel that drives devices of eldritch power: for the love of all things holy, GO FOR IT. (And then maybe talk to your therapist about those strange dreams you&#8217;re having.)

*You have what it takes believe in yourself.*

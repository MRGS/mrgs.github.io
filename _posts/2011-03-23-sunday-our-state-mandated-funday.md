We don&#8217;t often mention it, but we have a Mount Royal Game Society [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/montrealindies).

[Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/montrealindies).

[This is the Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/montrealindies).

Through the technomancy of that [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/montrealindies), we occasionally get together on weekends for productivity/cram sessions, where people can co-inspire and/or co-intimidate each other into getting work done. It&#8217;s fun! And there&#8217;s usually coffee.

The suggestion was recently made that we have a &#8220;mini game-jam,&#8221; on the scale of the [Klik of the Month](http://www.glorioustrainwrecks.com/node/44) jams; that is, about two to three hours. And it could happen THIS Sunday!

Head on over to [this thread](https://groups.google.com/group/montrealindies/browse_thread/thread/b7647f8dfc839188) in our Google Group (did you hear? we have one!) and contribute enjoyable words and sentences!

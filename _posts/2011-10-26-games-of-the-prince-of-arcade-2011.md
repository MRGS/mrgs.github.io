#### WHAT IS THIS NEW DEVILRY?

A splendourous and sibilant celebration of indie games and the arcade spirit!

We&#8217;re renting out an art gallery, hooking up the projectors, and basking in the glory of some of the most beautiful arcade-inspired indie games out there. Did we mention beer? The question is rhetorical; we didn&#8217;t! But the bar will indeed be available &#8212; and with a cold beverage in hand and the music moving our feet, we will play amazing games on amazing screens with amazing friends. (We have [anecdotal evidence][4] from last year&#8217;s event that this party will remain statistically amazing, within one standard deviation of happiness, 19 times out of 20.)

&nbsp;

#### WHEN AND WHERE DO WE HAVE THE JOY?

November 2nd, 20h00 &#8212; November 3rd, 01h00

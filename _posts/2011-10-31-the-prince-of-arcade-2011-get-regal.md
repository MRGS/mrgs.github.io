Well hey there, Sir or Madam.

Have you heard? The [Prince of Arcade][1] is two days hence, and it&#8217;s looking pretty magical. We&#8217;re storming an art gallery and projecting some of the latest in [beautiful arcade-style indie games][2] on the walls, toasting our health, and incredibleing the night away. And there&#8217;s a superlative Facebook [event][3], for all your legally-binding informational needs!

Oh, and then there&#8217;s this: we&#8217;re unveiling the [Arcade Royale][4].

We&#8217;ve been working hard with local hardware hackers the [Buttonmashers][5] and several local developers over the past few weeks, and good heavens are we excited about this thing. Five absolutely delicious multiplayer arcade games from Montreal developers (and one special visitor from out of town!) are loaded up and ready to rock you like a tropical depression at the Prince of Arcade. It&#8217;s overwhelming!

Let&#8217;s get to know our arcade guests, won&#8217;t you?

We&#8217;ve had the pleasure of playtesting these games in the Buttonmashers dojo, and the results are astounding. We&#8217;ll be talking more about each game in the weeks to come, but for now head over to the [Buttonmashers website][12] for some sweet, arcadey video action.  


Wait, you want more? Okay. Okay, fine. But don&#8217;t say we didn&#8217;t warn you.

### SURPRISE GUESTS:

B-Cycle, by Collectif IN-Média, is an thrilling bicycle journey&#8230; THROUGH THE HUMAN BODY.

We&#8217;re pumped (oh ho ho ho.)  


Oh, and hey, our co-organisers the [Dirty Rectangles][13] heard you like arcades, so they&#8217;re packing a minivan full of goodness, hitting up the T-Can, and unveiling their own classy cocktail cabinet: the *Ottatron*! Now you can play some arcades while your friends play arcades at the Prince of Arcade!  
  


And if *that* weren&#8217;t amazing enough, our friends at [die gute Fabrik][14] have hacked their fabulous *Johann Sebastian Joust* to bring us a brand new creature: *[Joust of Canada][15]*, a Boards of Canada physical bonanzarama. Will there be swords? There may be swords.

Throw in some surprise special guests, and there is no excuse to miss this! Literally, if the 2012 conspiracy were more than a silly fancy, and the world really were to come apart&#8212;a year early&#8212;in the coming week, and John Cusack&#8217;s Cessna was the only safe harbour left in the world, we would bring the party to the plane and rock these games across the planet Earth.

See you there.

Long Live the Prince.

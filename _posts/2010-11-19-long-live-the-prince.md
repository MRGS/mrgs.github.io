The [Prince of Arcade][2] came and went last week, and it&#8217;s safe to say it exceeded all our expectations. Roughly 250 [MIGS][3] attendees and other (highly intellectual and morally sound) lovers of indie games came together to sample from a glorious variety of titles:

*   *1… 2… 3… Kick It!* by [Dejobaan Games][4]
*   *A Slow Year* by [Ian Bogost][5]
*   *Halo 2600* by [Ed Fries][6]
*   *JoustPong* by [Kirk Israel][7]
*   *Nidhogg* by [Messhof][8] (Mark Essen)
*   *Octopounce* by [Anna Anthropy][9] & [Saelee Oh][10]
*   *Pico3* by Les Collégiennes ([Aliceffekt][11] & [Renaud Bédard][12])
*   *Project SkyFortress* by [Owen Deery][13] & [Gabriel Verdon][14]
*   Highlights of [TOJam 5][15], curated [Jim & Em McGinley][16]

Thankfully, there was a soundtrack to match, featuring some righteous DJ, chiptune, beatbox, and ukelele heroics from widely-acknowledged Super Awesome People:

*   Aliceffekt
*   Cadence Weapon
*   Marc & Coriander
*   circle triangle square
*   Rebecca Jurkovic

Of course, the party wouldn&#8217;t have been possible without: the incredible crew at the [Eastern Bloc][18]; the generous [sponsors and benefactors][19]; and all the volunteers who helped out whenever and wherever possible. Many thanks to each and every one of them, as well as to all the featured game developers and musicians who transmuted the event from a neat idea into something memorable. And look! There&#8217;s even photographic evidence of The Majesty:

*   Our friends and co-organisers [The Dirty Rectangles][20] have a [Flickr set][1] online.
*   Nick Rudzicz, co-organiser, has a set on [Picasa][17].
*   Aliceffekt, who contributed music *and* a game to the event, has posted a [Facebook album][21].
*   Jason Della Rocca has a nice [writeup][22] of MIGS itself, as well as some Prince of Arcade photos.
*   Trevor Jensen, another local photographer, also has a [Picasa][23] set.

Of course, let us know down in the comments if you have any more pictures you&#8217;d like to share.

Let&#8217;s do this again sometime.

Long Live the Prince.

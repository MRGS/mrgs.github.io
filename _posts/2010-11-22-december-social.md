It is December. Stay out of the malls! Their digestive glands activate this time of year. They found my uncle deep in the belly of Place Ville Marie last year, drained of all his fluids. And his charge card was maxed out. Do not risk it! Come to this fine MEETUP instead.

WHEN: Wednesday, December 1st, 19h00

WHERE: Brasserie Artisanale l’Amère à Boire, 2049 rue Saint-Denis, 3rd floor

WHO: You! (Hi there.) Artists, designers, musicians, coders, and folks who love to play and discuss and make games are welcome, as usual.

WOT: This month, Heather Kelley of the everlovin&#8217; [Kokoromi collective][1] will be dropping some knowledge, delivering this month&#8217;s opening salvo. &#8230;Or is it her parting shot? Is she even down with musketeering? Will someone bring holiday cookies? ALL OF YOUR QUESTIONS WILL BE ANSWERED AT THE APPOINTED DATE AND TIME. See you there!
